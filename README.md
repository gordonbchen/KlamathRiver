# KlamathRiver
Analyzing water flow of the Klamath River.

## Description
This project was made for the "Managing the Klamath River" Project in Chapter 6, Part 1 of the AP Calculus Textbook by Sullivan and Miranda.
The goal of this project was to explore the real-world applications of integrals and explore data science through python.

## Thanks
I would like to thank the following people:
- My AP Calc teacher Mr. Mildrum for allowing me to do this project through a jupyter notebook
- Writers of open source books on learning Data Science (Jake VanderPlas)
- Teams behind python and data science packages
